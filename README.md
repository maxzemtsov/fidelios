> ### 🚨 BREAKING: Third-party agent harnesses now cost extra. FideliOS doesn't.
>
> Starting April 2025, AI providers classify third-party harnesses (OpenClaw, Cline, and others) as **extra usage** — every agent run eats premium credits on top of your subscription. **FideliOS is immune.** We connect through official first-party CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) that run on your existing plan. No middleman. No markup. No surprise bills.
>
> But we don't just save you from surcharges — we **actively cut your token spend**. CAG pre-compiles full project context into ready-made bundles so agents get everything in one shot instead of burning tokens on repeated lookups. RAG retrieves only what's relevant instead of stuffing entire histories into every prompt. Session persistence and smart skip-detection eliminate redundant runs.
>
> Take it even further — plug in local models (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) and your cost approaches **literally zero** without sacrificing quality. Cloud for heavy lifting, local for routine tasks. Same orchestration, same governance, same audit trails.
>
> **Your subscription. Your tokens. Your rules.**

<br>

## What is FideliOS?

FideliOS is an **operating system for AI-driven companies**. You define the mission, hire a team of AI agents, set budgets and rules — and they figure out the work.

It's self-hosted, runs locally, and works with any agent runtime: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OpenClaw — anything that can receive an HTTP heartbeat.

```
You set the goal     →  "Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR"
You hire the team    →  CEO, CTO, engineers, marketers — any agent, any provider
You approve and go   →  Review strategy, set budgets, monitor from the dashboard
```

<br>

## Why FideliOS

**The before/after of managing AI agents:**

| 🔴 Without | 🟢 With FideliOS |
|:---|:---|
| 20 Claude Code tabs, no idea who does what. Reboot = start over. | Ticket-based tasks, threaded conversations, sessions persist across reboots. |
| Copy-pasting context between agents manually. | Context flows from task → project → company goal automatically. |
| Reinventing task management with folders and scripts. | Org charts, ticketing, delegation, governance — out of the box. |
| Runaway token costs you discover too late. | Budgets per agent + Peak Hours Guard to block expensive time windows. |
| Recurring jobs you forget to kick off. | Heartbeat scheduler handles it. Management supervises. |
| "Let me fire up Claude Code and babysit this tab..." | Add a task. Agent works until done. Management reviews. |
| Need laptop + terminal to manage anything. | PWA on any device. Telegram bot for approvals and updates on the go. |

<tr>
<td width="50%">

**🔌 Bring Your Own Agent** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OpenClaw, or any HTTP-compatible runtime. One org chart for all of them.

**🎯 Goal Alignment** — Every task traces back to the company mission. Agents always know *what* to do and *why*.

**💰 Cost Control** — Monthly budgets per agent. Peak Hours Guard blocks runs during expensive API windows.

**🏢 Multi-Company** — One deployment, many companies, complete data isolation.

**🎫 Ticket System** — Every conversation traced. Every decision explained. Full audit log.

## What makes FideliOS different

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **🔒 Subscription-safe** | First-party CLI integration means your agents run on your existing subscription — not on metered third-party credits. Zero extra usage fees, zero harness surcharges, zero surprises. |
| **CAG (Context-Augmented Generation)** | Pre-compiled context bundles so agents get full project state in one shot — no API round-trips, no hallucinated context. |
| **RAG-ready architecture** | Structured knowledge retrieval from issues, comments, goals, and org data — agents search, not guess. |
| **Token optimization** | Smart context compression, session persistence across heartbeats, and skip-detection to avoid wasting tokens on no-op runs. |
| **Process security** | Atomic task checkout, budget enforcement, approval gates, and full audit trails — no agent acts without authorization. |
| **Atomic execution** | Task checkout + budget check in one transaction. No double-work, no surprise bills. |
| **Persistent state** | Agents resume the same context across heartbeats — no "starting from scratch" every run. |
| **Skill injection** | Agents learn your workflows at runtime without retraining. |
| **Goal ancestry** | Every task carries the full chain: task → project → company goal. Agents see the big picture. |
| **Plugin-first** | Telegram, webhooks, custom tools — all through a first-class plugin SDK, not hacks. |
| **Zero cloud dependency** | Everything local. Your data stays on your machine. S3 backup is opt-in. |

## What FideliOS is NOT

> **Not a chatbot** — agents have jobs, not chat windows.
> **Not an agent framework** — we don't build agents, we run companies made of them.
> **Not a workflow builder** — no drag-and-drop. FideliOS models companies with org charts, goals, and governance.
> **Not for one agent** — if you have one agent, you don't need this. If you have twenty — you do.
